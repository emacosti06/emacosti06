### Mobile Full Stack Developer + UX Designer

I love developing products and services that help us improve our lives through technology, making it easy to access new tools to interact with the world simply and efficiently.

As a software developer, I had the chance to work with different technology, languages, and libraries throughout my career but I am more interested in developing for the mobile world (Android & iOS.)

In the recent past, I decided to expand my knowledge and I started to make my first steps in UX Design to find out how to make better products and services centered on their users.
